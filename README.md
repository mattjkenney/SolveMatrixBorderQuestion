Solves Matrix Border Question from Youtuber Clément Mihailescu

Youtuber Clément Mihailescu posted a video where he challenged Ben Awad to a coding challenge. Here's the challenge:
You have a 2-dimensional Matrix of 1's and 0's. Change all elements equal to 1 to 0, if and only if they are not 
connected to an element on the border by a chain of 1's. A border element is an element in the first row, last row, 
first column, or last column. The border element must also be equal to 1 in the chain of 1's. 

Here's a link the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tYoVx0QoN0&t=220s

This repository is my version of how to solve this challenge.
